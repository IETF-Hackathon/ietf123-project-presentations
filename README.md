# IETF 123 project presentations

This repo is intended for IETF Hackathon participants to retrieve templates for project presentations.  Since IETF 121, Hackathon presentations must be uploaded exclusively to datatracker.

For convenience, presentation templates are provided in [PPTX](presentation-template.pptx) and [HTML](presentation-template.html) formats, the latter of which can be viewed [online](https://ietf-hackathon.github.io/ietf123-project-presentations/presentation-template.html) if it is put in the [main branch](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf123-project-presentations/). For the HTML format, a corresponding [pdf](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf123-project-presentations/blob/pdfs-from-html/presentation-template.pdf) is automatically generated from the HTML file by a [GitHub action](.github/workflows/main.yml) and put in the [pdfs-from-html branch](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf123-project-presentations/tree/pdfs-from-html).  **Please note, you must upload the resulting PDF into the datatracker for the Hackathon results presentation slot on Sunday 14:00-16:00 local time.**

The use of these templates is optional. If you do use one of these templates, please rename the file such that it clearly identifies your project, e.g., includes the name or acronym of your project. Presenters are encouraged to run their own presentations using the screen sharing functionality in Meetecho. Alternatively, the Hackathon Chairs can share your presentation and advance slides for you.

**You MUST be a [member](https://github.com/orgs/IETF-Hackathon/people) of the [IETF-Hackathon](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) GitHub org** to add or update your HTML presentation and to generate the PDF.  Don't forget to upload the resulting PDF to the datatracker.

To be added as a member, please be sure to:

* include the [name](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/personalizing-your-profile#changing-your-profile-name) by which you are known as part of your in your GitHub profile

* send your GitHub username to [hackathon-chairs@ietf.org](mailto:hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)

**DO NOT WAIT** until just before project presentations start or your request may be lost in the chaos.
